# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description
- Work day schedule app that shows you the current day, date, and time.
- When a user clicks on a time slot they can enter their to do for that time.  When they click anywhere else on the page including the save button the data will be saved to localeStorage.
- Upon opening the page will display all saved data in the time slots. (One function I would like to add later is a way to clear all saved by time slot. By time slot since many actions are repeated each day.)
- The time slots are color coded to demonstrate past, present, and future.
